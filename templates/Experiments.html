    <h2>Model Output</h2>
    <div><font size="4">
        For each experiment, there is a choice of model output.
        The temperature is the new equilibrium temperature of the atmosphere,
        and it sometimes takes thousands of model years to reach this state.
        There is also the option to look at the
        <abbr title="In climate science, longwave radiation describes the
        radiation emitted from the surface and the atmosphere, a lot of which
        is infrared. If the temperature increases, the amount of longwave
        radiation emitted also increases." tabindex="-1">longwave</abbr> and
        <abbr title="In climate science, shortwave radiation refers to the
        radiation coming from the Sun, a lot of which is ultra-violet and
        visible light." tabindex="-1">shortwave</abbr>
        <abbr title="As molecules absorb radiation, they gain energy and the
        atmosphere warms. On the other hand, if the molecules emit radiation,
        they lose energy and the atmosphere cools. The heating rate describes
        how quickly the atmosphere warms or cools." tabindex="-1">radiative
            heating rates</abbr>,
        as well as the
        <abbr title="The convective adjustment in the model reduces the
        temperature of the surface and increases the temperature of the
        atmosphere.
        The convective heating rate describes how quickly these temperature
        changes occur." tabindex="-1">convective heating rate</abbr>.
        In equilibrium, the three heating rates should balance.
